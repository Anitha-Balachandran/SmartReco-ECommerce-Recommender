The Guest User Recommendation System is dedicated to delivering personalized product suggestions with a focus on "similar items you might like" for users without registered profiles. The recommendation process commences with meticulous data engineering, incorporating text cleaning to enhance the quality of product descriptions. Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization and lemmatization, ensures effective data transformation. Text vectorization using TFIDF numerically represents textual information, a crucial step for subsequent machine learning tasks. The prepared data undergoes segmentation into training, validation, and evaluation sets. In the modeling phase, an ensemble of machine learning models, including MultiNomial Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, is applied for category prediction. The trained ensemble model is saved for real-time implementation. In real-time, the recommendation engine processes user queries, predicts categories using the ensemble model, filters products, computes similarity scores, and presents the top 5 recommendations to the user. The outcomes of this model offer valuable insights into products similar to the selected one. The overall architecture is depicted as shown.
