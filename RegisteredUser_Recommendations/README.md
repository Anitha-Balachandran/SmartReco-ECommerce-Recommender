Catering specifically to Registered Users with Historical Data, this recommendation flow leverages the LightFM recommendation framework, a collaborative filtering-based system that tailors suggestions based on user interactions with items. The data cleaning and transformation process meticulously addresses missing values, duplicates, and filters data for relevance. An interactive matrix is prepared for modeling, and the dataset is strategically split for training, validation, and evaluation purposes. The LightFM model, utilizing stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization, undergoes training with three distinct loss functions. The selected LightFM model, employing logistic regression, is seamlessly integrated into the recommendation engine, providing personalized 'Top Picks for You' recommendations based on user similarity matrices. The final model results highlight the top 5 recommendations for a specific user ID. The Registered User recommendation process is visually represented in below figure.
