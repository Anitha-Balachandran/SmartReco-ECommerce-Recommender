Applicable to both registered and guest users (All), the recommendation flow introduces the "Customers who bought this item also bought" Recommendation Feature by leveraging product purchase history metadata. Data cleaning encompasses handling missing data, eliminating duplicates, and filtering data for relevance. Text transformation involves tokenization and lemmatization, followed by vectorization for modeling purposes. The recommendation system utilizes product metadata, specifically "also buy" and "also view" information, employing KNN with cosine similarity for enhanced relevance. The outcome of this model provides users with informed suggestions, highlighting products that have been frequently purchased alongside the chosen item by other customers. The All user recommendation process is visually represented in below figure.
